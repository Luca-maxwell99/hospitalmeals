# Description
Meal management is a significant problem for patients within hospitals due to a lack of independence. Often, patients have no choices of their own, which can hinder their recovery. A crucial part of healthcare recovery is gradually increasing independence, and what better way to do that than allowing patients to select their own meals?

Meal Manager aims to remove barriers to accessing and delivering healthcare. With 2+ years of experience working in a hospital environment, I have witnessed firsthand how patients receive incorrect meals due to inefficient, paper-based food ordering systems. This method takes valuable time away from patient care. The solution: a meal selection app enabling users/patients to select their own meals, ensuring they receive correct meals and better care, all aligned with NHS values.
