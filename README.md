# Description
Meal management is a significant problem for patients within hospitals due to a lack of independence. Often, patients have no choices of their own, which can hinder their recovery. A crucial part of healthcare recovery is gradually increasing independence, and what better way to do that than allowing patients to select their own meals?



Meal Manager aims to remove barriers to accessing and delivering healthcare. With 2+ years of experience working in a hospital environment, I have witnessed firsthand how patients receive incorrect meals due to inefficient, paper-based food ordering systems. This method takes valuable time away from patient care. The solution: a meal selection app enabling users/patients to select their own meals, ensuring they receive correct meals and better care, all aligned with NHS values.

# Use of AI

1. AI-powered tools, like GitHub Copilot, can help generate boilerplate code and suggest code snippets as you write. This can speed up the development process and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks.

2. AI can assist in generating user stories by analyzing project requirements and breaking them down into detailed tasks. This ensures comprehensive coverage of user needs and project goals.

The integration of AI tools into this project significantly boosted efficiency, enabling me to concentrate on higher-level decisions and manual debugging tasks. AI served as a collaborative partner, complementing my skills rather than replacing them. Each suggestion provided by AI was carefully evaluated and adapted to align with the unique requirements of the project.

This journey not only enhanced my technical expertise but also sharpened my problem-solving and decision-making abilities. It underscored the value of embracing new technologies as instrumental tools in advancing development efforts.
